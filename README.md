HTML-Only Share Buttons
=======================

This is a derived work based on the original idea of [Gregory Schier](http://schier.co).

What is missing in Gregory's otherwise excellent work is text context for links. They have no text labels, titles or alts. So if for some reason FontAwesome fails to load, or you are usign screen reader or other assistive technology - you will see nothing (maybe a color will be a visual clue if you know [Brand Colors](http://brandcolors.net/)).

Here are some social buttons that don't require any Javascript. Just HTML, CSS, and some Font Awesome icons.
